								<h2>PAEDIATRIC CLINIC</h2>
								<p>The practice of Paediatrics, regardless of professional discipline, is based on the dictum that children are unique individuals undergoing the process of human development and not little adults. Paediatrics began to emerge as a medical specialty late in the nineteenth century in response to the growing appreciation that the health problems generally seen in children are different from those affecting the adult population.</p>
