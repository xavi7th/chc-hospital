                        <p>Capitol Hill Clinic / Hospital Dialysis Department is staffed by doctors and nurses who are
                          experts in internal medicine and nephrology (kidney treatment). Vascular surgeons make rounds in
                          each of our centers. We are very proud of the results we help our patients achieve. Our doctors
                          are endlessly involved in research to improve dialysis and kidney treatment and we strive to
                          bring the results of this research into the daily care of our patients.</p>

                        <p>According to the latest studies, the survival rate of our patients is better than expected,
                          only 2% of dialysis units nationwide can make this claim.

              <p>We treat as many of our patients as possible through AV fistulas. This method, which uses the patientâ€™s
                own blood vessels, is the one most often recommended by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services.
                Capitol Hill Clinic / Hospital dialysis center have documented lower rates of infection than the national
                benchmark; this is an important measure that is proven to improve mortality.</p>
