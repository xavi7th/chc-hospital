                <h2>Dermatology Clinic</h2>
                <p>We at Capitol Hill Clinic/Hospital fully understand that the our patient's skin is the largest organ of
                  their body, and it is also one of the first things people notice. Clear, beautiful skin is as much in
                  demand as straight teeth, shiny hair, and nice clothes. We also understand that Radiant skin can boost
                  self-esteem and re-make a person’s self image. That is why we decided to establish a standard
                  Dermatology Clinic in Our hospital. </p>

              <p>Our Dermatologist uses Photodynamic light therapy to treat Acne. This is a blue light laser that is
                effective for treating even the most stubborn and severe acne. Acne is the term for plugged pores
                (blackheads and whiteheads), pimples, and even deeper lumps (cysts or nodules) that occur on the face,
                neck, chest, back, shoulders and the upper arms. Acne results from the obstruction and inflammation of the
                sebaceous glands, and it affects 80% of the human population.

              <p>Acne scarring is a common problem and severe scarring often cannot be covered by makeup and need
                professional treatment for removal. To avoid acne scarring, treating acne early is important. Photodynamic
                therapy (PDT) is a non-invasive therapy that utilizes light treatments along with an application of a
                photo-sensitizing agent. PDT was originally approved by the National Agency For Food and Drug
                Administration Control NAFDAC for the treatment of cancer, and is often used to treat actinic keratosis.
                It is now being used off label as a safe and effective treatment for acne. </p>
