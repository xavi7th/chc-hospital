							<h2>Vaccination Services</h2>
							<p>Vaccines have contributed to a significant reduction in many childhood infectious diseases, such as
								diphtheria, measles, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Some infectious diseases, such as polio
								and smallpox, have been eliminated in Nigeria due to effective vaccines. It is now rare for children in
								Nigeria to experience the devastating and often deadly effects of these diseases that were once common
								in Nigeria and other countries with high vaccination coverage.</p>

											<p>The vast majority of vaccines are given to healthy babies, children and adults; therefore,
												Capitol Hill Clinic / Hospital has made it is critical that vaccines be demonstrated to be safe
												and effective. Ensuring the safety and effectiveness of vaccines is one of the top priorities of
												Capitol Hill Clinic / Hospital. The viruses and bacteria that cause vaccine-preventable diseases
												and death still exist and can be passed on to people who are not protected by vaccines. </p>

											<p>Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can cause severe complications, including
												pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and death. Outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as measles,
												serve as a reminder that they are only a plane-ride away and the best way not to get sick is to
												get Vaccinated.</p>

						<h4>Benefit Of Infant And Adult Vaccination </h4>
						<p>A vaccine is a medication. Like any medicine, vaccines have benefits and risks, and although highly
							effective, no vaccine is 100 percent effective in preventing disease or 100 percent safe in all
							individuals. Most side effects of vaccines are usually minor and short-lived. For example, a person may
							feel soreness at the injection site or experience a mild fever. Serious vaccine reactions are extremely
							rare, but they can happen.</p>
