							<h2>Hearing Conservation</h2>
							<p>Hearing loss is one of the most pervasive occupational health problems in Nigeria today. Approximately
								30 million employees are exposed to noise levels that are potentially hazardous to their hearing.
								Fortunately, noise-induced hearing loss can be reduced, or often eliminated, through the successful
								application of occupational hearing conservation programs. Additionally, an effective program reduces
								potential worker compensation claims. </p>
