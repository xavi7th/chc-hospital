                <h2>Private Insurance Scheme</h2>
                <p>Insurance is the equitable transfer of the risk of a loss, from one entity to another in exchange for
                  payment. It is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent,
                  uncertain loss. An insurer, or insurance carrier, is a company selling the insurance; the insured, or
                  policyholder, is the person or entity buying the insurance policy.
